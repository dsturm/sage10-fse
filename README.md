# Sage 10 with Gutenberg Full Site Editing (FSE)

## Requirements

- The [Gutenberg Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) is not required, but adds extra Gutenberg-specific functionality that is missed otherwise in WordPress core.
- A [patched `roots/acorn` package](https://github.com/roots/acorn/pull/141) is used by the theme as theme runtime dependency (in theme [`composer.json`](https://github.com/strarsis/sage10-fse/blob/master/composer.json#L43-L49)) which loader preserves the block template paths.

## Theme installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Invoke `composer install`.
3. (Optional) Ensure suitable `node` version, e.g. using `nvm` from the `.nvmrc` by invoking `nvm install && nvm use`.
4. Invoke `npm install`.
5. Invoke `npm run build`.
6. (Mount the theme into a WordPress site and activate it).
7. Open the Site Editor:
  - Admin area → Appearance → Edit (beta)
  - (Logged in as editor+) → Front end → Admin bar → Edit Site

## Theme structure

```sh
themes/your-theme-name/   # → Root of your Sage based theme
├── templates/            # → Block templates directory (❗required for a FSE theme (for the `index.php` inside)) (formerly named `block-templates`)
│   ├── index.html        # → Block template for the posts (fallback) (❗required for a FSE theme)
│   ├── page.html         # → Block template for singular page
│   ├── home.html         # → Block template for posts page (specific page selected as blog page)
│   └── front-page.html   # → Block template for front page (specific page selected as front page)
├── parts/                # → Block parts directory (can be used in block templates, among others) (formerly named `block-parts`)
│   ├── header.html       # → Block part for a header (there can be more headers, if needed)
│   └── footer.html       # → Block part for a footer (there can be more footers, if needed)
├── patterns/             # → Block patterns directory
│   └── some-pattern.php  # → Block example pattern
├── theme.json            # → Generated by Sage theme build process (`bud`) or directly edited (❗required for a FSE theme)
```

## Notes

- `add_theme_support('block-templates');` is not needed when theme is already autodetected to be a FSE theme (by presence of `theme.json` and `templates/`).
- Disabling FSE using `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` is ignored when block templates are in place, `Design → Editor` is still offered to the user. – But this will currently result in an [unexpected, non-JSON-, HTML-response for `_wp-find-template`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170#issuecomment-1287434694), preventing the Gutenberg Editor from initializing, hence the Gutenberg Editor page stays blank.
- Block styles currently can't be registered by convention (as by adding them as files into a specific folder, using meta data as comments/JSON, as this is already possible with block patterns). – Currently block styles can only be registered using [`register_block_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_style/) (in server-side PHP) or [`registerBlockStyle`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-styles/) (in editor JavaScript). This can change with future releases of Gutenberg and WordPress core.
- Get the translation source strings using the WP CLI [`i18n`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/i18n/), as this tool is able to parse not only the normal core PHP WordPress translation functions, but also all the metadata in `theme.json`; Block patterns and Block parts. – And recently it can also parse [Blade-PHP template files](https://github.com/wp-cli/i18n-command/pull/304).

## Known issues and fixes

### Template part blocks can't render; JavaScript error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tinymce' [...]` in Gutenberg Editor

Block template or block parts contain plain, "naked" HTML without block-specific comments.

- <https://github.com/bobbingwide/sb/issues/6>

### Customization by user
By default the user can override the theme-provided block templates and block parts, those modifications are stored as special posts in database.
The site editor sidebar can be opened by clicking on the logo/icon on the upper left corner in the side editor.
From that sidebar the block templates and template parts lists can be viewed and the user customizations reset.

### Home versus Front page templates
This was a gotcha for me, as I first hadn't completely understood the exact difference between those two.
This very well made article explains the differences:
https://davidsutoyo.com/articles/difference-front-page-php-home-php/

### Gutenberg Editor/JavaScript errors like `Block "core/post-comments" is not registered` (for _comment_-specific core blocks)
The [`Disable Comments Plugin`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) may cause this as it can also remove the comment-specific core blocks.

### Gutenberg Editor/JavaScript errors like `Block "core/post-title" is not registered` (for _blog-_/_post_-specific core blocks)
The [`Disable Blog Plugin`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-blog/) may cause this as it can also remove the blog-/post-specific core blocks.

### The Gutenberg Editor page loads but stays blank
This happens when the backend sends an unexpected response (invalid JSON (so also just frontend HTML) or no response. The Gutenberg Editor [currently catches any JSON parse errors and silently stops initializing](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170) (staying blank). 
Adding or changing the order of template loaders can cause this, hence this example Sage 10 FSE theme uses a patched version of the Sage theme `acorn` runtime that doesn't respond [with a matching Blade-PHP non-block template](https://github.com/roots/acorn/issues/228).
Also the aforementioned [disabling FSE using `remove_theme_support('block-templates')` in a FSE theme](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45170#issuecomment-1287434694) causes this.
